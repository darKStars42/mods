CONVERSATION TOPICS:

There are four! 

If you wish to have your custom NPC participate in all the pride fun, here is the context for each CT as well as the key you would add as an entry to your dialogue patch.

- WelcomeToPridePITV: this triggers after the farmer receives their subscription confirmation.
- PrideSeasonStartPITV, this triggers on the first day of Summer, when the farmer receives their first official volume of GFSP. If an NPC has a subscription, or is close to someone that does, they could comment on it, otherwise use this CT creatively!
- PrideSeasonGiftPITV: this triggers on the 15th day of Summer with the farmer's weekly Summer gift from GSFP. The Pride Season Festival is coming up in a few days, so everyone is talking about it! 
- HatMouseTheAllyPITV: this triggers when the farmer receives mail from the hat mouse, in the middle of Fall. This is a passive conversation topic, meaning only the farmer has received it (the hat mouse is teeny and can only go so far), so use this creatively!

PRIDE SEASON FESTIVAL: 

The Pride Season Festival will take place in the Town map, right near the Community Center, on Summer 15, Summer 16, and Summer 17. The shops and prices will vary depending on the day as well as which mods you have installed. Check the description on Nexus for mods that add content to the Pride Festival!

Every vanilla NPC, with a few exceptions, will only visit once! So there should be plenty of spots available for your NPC to visit. If you'd like to claim one, please reach out to me on Discord (sapphicsaph) and I will add you to the list!!
