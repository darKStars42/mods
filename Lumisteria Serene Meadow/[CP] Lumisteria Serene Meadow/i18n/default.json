A colleague did researches on plants, and found that 'Forget-Me-Not', 'Butterfly Lavender', 'Calendula', and 'Hollyhock' were good candidate to obtain hybrids.^She said the list isn't complete however, but it's a good start.^Here are some Forget-Me-Not seeds if you want to try it out yourself.^Grow them next to each others. Once fully grown, hybrid may appears on tiled ground around them.^Sometimes you may get seeds when harvesting them too, but it's less common.^The most common hybrid are obtained with just the base crop, but the rarest requires more complex set-up.^^-  Demetrius",

It's a joy to see what colors you'll obtain.^Since they can grow in a lot of seasons, you have more chance to obtain hybrids.^On hollyhock, the rarest varieties are often selling better, according to a florist friend.^On some other plants, I obtained more flowers. I like observing such things, it's one of the joy of gardening.^^-  Evelyn",
