This file is triggered (for this mod only) for dialogues & schedules . It contains no data, which is its purpose. So you can have one file with conditions (instead of many files triggered if conditions in "content.json" are met --> really bad troubleshooting) in files for dialogues, schedules, etc.

This file is created after asking at SV's Discord why schedule in my mod won't work. User aviroen2 saved me. Thanks so much!
