BEFORE YOU PLAY...
• i haven't quite ironed out the harvesting mechanic! at least for now, EITHER wool or milk can be harvested in a day, and sheep will appear sheared when ready to milk
• only Partially compatible with better ranching! turn off "prevent failed harvesting" to run milkable sheep alongside it

UNINSTALLATION
• drag this baby out of your mods folder. that's it!
• your sheep may still produce error items when you reopen your save. they should be back to normal after you "shear" them and go to sleep, and the error items can then be safely thrown away or sold for a clean uninstall!
