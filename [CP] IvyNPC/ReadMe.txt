Thank you for downloading the IvyMod!

This was a small little passion project of mine for the SDV Modding Contest and is by no means perfect, theres a couple slips here and there but
I had fun making it and I hope you have fun playing it <3

If you encounter any crashes or errors, scroll to the bottom of your SMAPI console where there should be red text
and screenshot anything there then get in contact with me.
