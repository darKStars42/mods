Behaviorally they are similar to other bovids, herbivores living in mostly-female herds protected by a dominant male. The domestic variety is a source of milk and a beast of burden.",

With their fatty hump and lack of horns, they are sometimes mistaken for tiny camelids, but in fact are most closely related to sheep. The trabuul is an unexpected ecosystem engineer of the desert; they primarily feed on high-nutrient roots and fruits, digging small burrows and pits to access the former (as well as for shelter during the heat of day). Discarded trabuul burrows provide vital shelter for various other desert dwellers and their digging churns up vital early nutrients for the various plants that rely on them for seed dispersal. Some sites are popular year after year, and these so-called 'trabuul oases are precious for desert traversal, serving as both useful landmarks and crucial sources of natural food. Leftover roots, flowers, and clay from trabuul burrowing efforts range from helpful forage to valuable trade goods; they are not utilized for wool as their natural coat is short and very coarse, making it a poor material for textiles. Skittish and short-tempered, trabuul will sometimes attack humans with their sharp hooves, which males also use to fight in the breeding season.",

Their maternal instinct is strong; they will adopt orphaned kits from other tribes as well as young animals of other species. They have been known to guide lost humans to safety as well and are relatively strong swimmers. In captivity, the Narula is prized for its fur, which it naturally sheds in the warm months.",

These hogs have muscular bodies, facial tusks, and an omnivorous diet. Although they are solitary animals, they do form family units. While the females are less prone to violence, it is not advised to domesticate the Tuusca, as they tend to be aggressive and highly territorial.",

The oldest female in the group is the boss and the chicks are usually equals until the largest takes second in command. Once a formidable predator in the Arcanian island system. However, the arrival of humans to Arcania significantly shifted the relationship between these raptors and the land, as well as its fauna. Through generations of effort, the Movoraptor was domesticated and trained to protect and care for its human counterparts. Due to their territorial instincts, female raptors often adopt groups of humans as their own offspring. In rare cases, they may select a human as a lifelong companion.Selective breeding has also transformed the reproductive process of the Movoraptors. Originally a species that relied on sexual reproduction, females have developed the ability to reproduce asexually through a process known as parthenogenesis. As a result, a male Movoraptor is produced in only two out of every twenty eggs laid.",

As the male chicks tend to be significantly smaller than females, they are frequently eaten by their larger sisters. Those that survive generally do so by being found and recruited by adult males, who are otherwise not allowed to raise chicks.The dynamic between female and male Movoraptors is a complex one. While females group up units of five to ten; the males tend to group in pairs of two to four. However, both males and females operate under the control of analpha female, who tends to be the oldest and strongest female among the flock. Male raptors will live at a distance from the females, only approaching to scavenge, recruit male hatchlings, and attempt to mate.",

Flying in flocks of three, these birds are scavengers and feed on carrion, but will also eat several foul-smelling plants such as the luna fly bloom and the rot lily. Unlike its larger counterparts, the Dea bird tends to approach humans for social interaction. A act that most Arcanians consider a bad omen.",

Adapted to live alongside Arcania’s predators, they are more skittish, faster, and stronger than most other Raphus species. As with many other Raphus’s, human hunting has damaged their population, and they are a protected species as such.",

Studies of its genes and physiology have confirmed that its closest relatives are not dogs but bears, though debate about whether it is a true ursid or not continues. Some have proposed new common names to reflect this discovery, but as it is best known as the raccoon dog that is how we will refer to it. How this creature first came to Arcania and into contact with the native people is unclear, but it has been domesticted for centuries. The raccoon dog is generally used in hunting; though it is readily outsped by true hounds, its talent is in its bulk and natural ambush abilities.  In traditional Arcanian hunting a well-trained raccoon dog will flush prey out of the bush to where the hunter can more easily target it, help take down larger prey, and deter potential threats to the hunters such as durrahs. Highly loyal and with a powerful bite force, they will guard their human companions with their lives, though it can be difficult to retrieve carcasses that they get ahold of. Females with cubs can be aggressive and great care must be taken in breeding them. The vocalizations of the raccoon dog can be intimidating to those who haven't heard them before.",

Genetic and fossil evidence indicates that it and the Gotoran war elephant (G. ares) share a common ancestor, the now extinct Gotoran coastal pygmy elephant (G. lanceum). Where the war elephant was deliberately bred for larger size and increased aggression, however, the ancestral population that arrived on Arcania faced a much different challenge. The larger mammal niches were occupied, and Arcania's predators were well-suited to hunt them at their current size. Interspecific competition and the island's limited resources prevented them from becoming larger, so instead, they rapidly shrank. The resultant elephant is one of the smallest mammals on the island, but the small size allows them to avoid predation. They live relatively solitary lives, and are important dispersers of low-lying fruit. The miniphant has been a popular pet in Arcania for centuries, and is slowly gaining popularity among exotic pet enthusiasts. As with most pachyderms, they are semi-aquatic.",
