    "Mail Text": "Dear @^^Hello. Did you know that there is a flooded cave in stardew?^I was on my way back from renovating your house when I suddenly remembered that I had cleaned up the road to it in a neat and tidy way.^I know it's unnecessary for us, but I thought you might be able to make good use of it.^^-Robin",


    "Mail Title 2": "I just repaired a mine cart in flooded cave.",

    "Mail Text 2": "Dear @^^Robin will have told you about the flooded cave.^Actually, Stardew's mine cart leads to that place too.^When they used that place as a quarry and warehouse in the old days, the mine carts used to operate there, but one day the tracks broke.^No one went there anymore, so I just left it there...^Robin told @ about the cave and Willy asked me to fix his mine cart because it's a good location for fishing.^I pushed Clint to do his best. Say thank you to him!^^-Lewis",
