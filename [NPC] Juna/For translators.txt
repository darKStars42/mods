FOR TRANSLATORS

2.2.0-2.2.2
Converted Juna's ring from JA to CP. This means: a) that you can delete the entire [CC] folder from your upload, as the JA/object.json no longer exists in the original mod, and b) move the translations to the bottom of the i18n file instead (see bottom of the default.json).

2.1.6
Additional dialogue added at the bottom of the default.json. Moved some location based dialogue from the Dialogue files to the i18n file due to a bug in the game; please remove the affected dialogue strings from Dialogue, Dialogue2 and Dialogue3 and add them to the end of your i18n translations (compare with the English files to see what's changed).

2.1.5
Added some new dialogue for 1.6 upgrade, see bottom of default.json. Made some edits to either dialogue or code, marked with EDIT! in the default.json.

GENERAL TRANSLATION INSTRUCTIONS

There are three things that need to be translated in Juna:

- The default.json in the i18n folder
	Contains the majority of Juna's content. When you're done, simple rename your file using the appropriate language code (example: es.json for Spanish).

- The DialogueForTranslation.json in the Translation folder
	Contains Juna's daily dialogue. When you've translated this, I recommend sending it to me so I can help you put it back in its proper place. As you can see in the Dialogue folder, Juna's daily dialogue is split between 3 different files, and it can be confusing putting it back yourself. Simply translating this document and leaving it as is won't work.

When you're ready to upload your translation mod, the folder structure should look like this in order for your translation to overwrite the English text properly:

[NPC] Juna
|
|-[CP] Juna
|	|-assets
|		|-Dialogue
|			|-Dialogue.json
|			|-Dialogue2.json
|			|-Dialogue3.json
|	|-i18n
|		|-yourlanguagecode.json
