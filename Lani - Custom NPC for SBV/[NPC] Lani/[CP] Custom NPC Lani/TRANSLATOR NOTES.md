////////////////////////////////// END OF NPC DICTIONARY /////////////////////////////////////////////// 

KOREAN / 한국어
--------------------
Lani uses a lot of slang in normal speech and has the equivalent of a Seoul accent. In 0-2 hearts, she will use formal speak. At 4 hearts, she will switch to 반말 with the player. When asking questions, she will ALWAYS end with -냐 because she thinks it makes her sound tough. She grew up with two brothers, so she tends to prefer the more masculine -냐.

Example:
뭐해 -> 
	뭐해요 O (0-2 Hearts)
	뭐하냐 O (4 Hearts+)
	뭐하니 X

Some words (slang and otherwise) that Lani says a lot, with line examples:
	- lowkey -> 약간 (See: Lani.Dialogue.luauPoisoned)
	- y'know -> you know -> 뭔 느낌인지 알지? (See: Lani.Dialogue.Sun6.0, Lani.Dialogue.Tue10.2)
	- guess what x -> 야야 ___~거든 (See: Lani.Dialogue.summer_15)
	- recluse -> outsider -> 아싸* (See: Lani.Dialogue.Mon8.1)
		* NOT 폐인, different meaning
	- fandom -> fan activity -> 덕질 (See: Lani.Dialogue.Wed6.2)
	- fake -> staged/fabrication -> 주작 (See: Lani.Dialogue.Fri10.1) (EX: 이거 주작 아니야?)
	- vibe -> 폼 (See: Lani.Dialogue.Sat6.2)
	- veg out -> being idle/useless/not do anything -> 잉여??? (See: Lani.Dialogue.winter_Fri4) 
	- honestly -> 솔까 (See: Lani.Dialogue.Thu6.1)

Lani references a lot of media in her dialogue, so do like 웹툰 artists do and make knockoff names!

IN-UNIVERSE/"KNOCKOFF" --- ACTUAL/COPYRIGHTED
Matsune Hiku (마츠네 히쿠) --- Hatsune Miku (하츠네 미쿠)
PocketMon (포케몬?) --- Pokemon (포켓몬) (In this case, I'd transliterate how it's said in English, maybe... Or censor some other way.)
SeeYou (싀유? C유? ㅋ) --- SeeU (시유)
Crisp Rat (크리스프 랫, literally 바삭바삭한 쥐 ㅋㅋㅋ) --- Chris Pratt (크리스 프랫)


JAPANESE / 日本語
--------------------
Lani uses a lot of スラング in normal speech and has the equivalent of a Gyaru/valley girl accent due to where she's from. To compare her speech pattern to a person, she would talk similarly to artist PiNKII who commonly speaks some ギャル語. 

ラニはギャルですか？ いいえ、ギャルじゃないです。 But the gyaru voice matches Lani's character when she's friendlier to you. From ハートが0～2個, she will speak 丁寧語, but ハートが4～10個 is a mix of 砕けた/ギャル語.

Examples from PiNKII's TikTok:

I don't know enough 日本語 to give any vocabulary examples from the NPC Dictionary, ごめんなさい T_T But, there are lots of Japanese media/game/music references in her dialogue. Hopefully these examples help with translation! 

IN-UNIVERSE/"KNOCKOFF" --- ACTUAL/COPYRIGHTED
Matsune Hiku (松根ヒク？) --- Hatsune Miku (初音ミク)
PocketMon (ポケットモン) --- Pokemon (ポケモン)
GOOMY (グミ) --- GUMI/Megpoid (ボイスバンク) (On the Vocaloid website, グミ is referred to as ボイスバンク, so I think calling her グミ is okay.)
SeeYou (シーユー) --- SeeU (シユ) (シユ is the official Japanese name, so perhaps the ー makes it distinct...)
YUMAHA (ユマハ) --- YAMAHA (ヤマハ)
World is Hiku's (ワールドイズヒク) --- World is Mine (ワールドイズマイン)
Crisp Rat (クリスプ・ラット) --- Chris Pratt (クリス・プラット) wwwww
Keekuo (キクオ？) --- Kikuo (きくお)
Fame Greak (フェムグリーク) --- Game Freak (ゲームフリーク) www
The Superb 4 (四偉王？) --- The Elite Four (四天王)

Alternatively, you can also just censor with ◯ to get something like ポ◯モン, which maybe is more common? Choose whichever you like more *^^* Knockoff names are funny in English, but I don't know if they censor brand names and stuff like that in Japan.
