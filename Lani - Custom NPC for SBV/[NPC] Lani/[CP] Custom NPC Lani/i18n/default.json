It sounds straight out of a TV show.$16#$b#You get a letter from your grandfather, get a whole bunch of land, and escape the city to become a farmer...$12#$b#I guess there really isn't a problem with starting something new. You're right, @.$1",

	"PaintingWithLyenne.5": "It's clear the brush strokes on the left are hesitant, trying to form a hazy idea, but the ones on the right are careless, angry, and resentful.",
	"PaintingWithLyenne.6": "It's not bad, all things considered, but it's not what Lani's aiming for.",
	"PaintingWithLyenne.7": "I tried to be a little more 'interpretive' and paint a representation of an emotion, but you can obviously see how that went.$6",
