	"TitaniaGrapes.text": "Dear @,^^As a well respected member of the vinter community, we thought it would be prudent to inform you of the little know fact of Titania Grapes.^^It has been reported up and down the country that very occasionally, a Common Grape has... produced something unusual when placed in a Seed Maker. The vine it produces is several times the size of the usual Common Grape vine, and produces grapes as large as a watermelon.^^We are conducting research into this unusual variety and would like to ask for your help. If you are able to grow one of these Titania vines please ship some of the grapes out to us. In return, we will be able to share with you a VERY rare grape variety. We look forward to working with you again.^^Yours.^Tamina Carvell.",

	"AncientStarter.text": "Dear @.^^My sincerest thanks to you. With your contributions we have been able to unravel the mystery of the Titania Grape.^^It is interesting that they do not create their own unique flavour of wine, instead providing at least three times the amount of product a regular Common Grape produces.^^We hope to have these oversized vines available to buy from your local farming goods store shortly.^^In return for your incredible work, we would like to provide you with the Rarest grape in our sphere of knowledge.^^This Ancient Grape is the earliest form of grape we have identified, being the progenitor to all other grapes. There are only a handful of places in the world this Grape grows, and we look forward to seeing it thrive on your farm. Hopefully one day I can find the time to visit your farm in person.^^Yours.^Tamina Carvell ",

There are three common variants of wine in ciruclation; Sparkling, Sweet and Fortified.^^One of the most popular is Sparkling Wine. To create this bubbly beverage, you must combine Yeast and Grapes in a Hardwood Keg. You can buy yeast from most stores (Joja or local farm goods suppliers) but this can be costly.
