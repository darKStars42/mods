"Alchemist_Dialogue.spring_12": "The egg festival? I would not miss it for anything!#$b#It might not have any more of its pagan roots, but it is still a lovely way to welcome in the spring season with friends.",
"Alchemist_Dialogue.spring_23": "Wouldn't it be neat if, one year, the ceremony was actually flowers dancing instead of humans?#$b#It certainly would be funny to see the young ones reactions to a bunch of dancing daisies!",

//Fall

//Winter
"Alchemist_Dialogue.winter_1": "Winter means less farming and more foraging!#$b#I'm on the hunt for something new and exciting, @. Here's hoping I find it!",

//Base Dialogue

"Alchemist_Dialogue.Mon": "Do you know how foxgloves got their name?#$b#Apparently, fairies slipped the flowers onto the feet of mischievous foxes so they could sneak into henhouses and steal chickens!$1", 
"Alchemist_Dialogue.Tue": "I could never be a flower farmer, @.$s#$b#Instead of picking the flowers to sell, I'd just end up leaving them all in the ground to stare at all season long!$h",
"Alchemist_Dialogue.Wed": "What is an alchemist?#$b#Well, it's someone who takes materials found in the wild and transforms them into entirely new things to help themselves and their community.#$b#Oh, and maybe a bit of magic thrown in for good measure, but don't tell the wizard that.$6",
"Alchemist_Dialogue.Thu": "Never be without a foraging basket, @. Who knows what you might find on your daily trip into town?#$b#$1# For example, I found these lovely mushrooms just outside Robin's house!$1",
"Alchemist_Dialogue.Fri": "The weekend is approaching! Should I curl up with an alchemy book or go off exploring?#$b#Hmm, decisions, decisions.",
"Alchemist_Dialogue.Sat": "Have you taken a look at the woods behind the wizard's house?$3#$b#I thought I spied some interesting forage in that direction...",
"Alchemist_Dialogue.Sun": "Have you had a relaxing weekend, @? I would hate to hear you are overworking yourself!#$b#One should always schedule in plenty of time for a little mischief.$6",

"Alchemist_Dialogue.Mon2": "Interested in alchemy? I must say, you already have a knack for it, @.#$b#How else do you manage to cook such elaborate meals so quickly?", 
"Alchemist_Dialogue.Tue2": "Have you had any luck getting to know Rose, @? You said she squeaks and runs away when you try to talk to her?#$b#Ah, well, just keep at it. I am sure she'll open up to you in no time.",
"Alchemist_Dialogue.Wed2": "Do you have a favorite flower, @?#$b#If I had to pick, I think I'd say peonies are my favorite. They are just so fluffy and lovely.",
"Alchemist_Dialogue.Thu2": "If you're cutting some of your growing flowers for an arrangement, be sure to cut the stems at an angle.#$b#This allows them to absorb the water in the vase better and last longer!",
"Alchemist_Dialogue.Fri2": "Sometimes my eyes are bigger than my stomach.#$b#I should go share some of my extra mushrooms with Linus. The man knows how to make an excellent mushroom kebab...$1",
"Alchemist_Dialogue.Sat2": "I think I'll stay in and bake a pie or two today.#$b#I have to use up these foraged berries somehow.",
"Alchemist_Dialogue.Sun2": "...huh, what was that?#$b#Sorry, I was thinking about how to craft a new alchemy machine.",

"Alchemist_Dialogue.Mon4": "Sprout would like to know if you have any treats for him.#$b#If not, he would like to suggest you bring strawberries next time you see him.", 
"Alchemist_Dialogue.Tue4": "The wizard? What about them?$5#$b#No, we don't talk much.$6#$b#They think magic and alchemy should be kept hidden from most folks and I just do not see it as an issue.#$b#$1Folks should help each other out! Magical, alchemical, or otherwise, don't you think, @?",
"Alchemist_Dialogue.Wed4": "I was reading in one my tomes the other day of a mushroom forest where giant mushroom trees grew.#$b#Wouldn't such a place be a forager's dream come true? I wonder if the story is based on any real life location...",
"Alchemist_Dialogue.Thu4": "What do I do with all the stuff I forage?#$b#Friend, what DON'T I do?#$b#It can be transformed into teas, potpourri, perfumes, baked goods...#$b#I promise I don't use the poisonous mushrooms for that last one.$6",
"Alchemist_Dialogue.Fri4": "I found some rare mushrooms the other day and shared a few with Maru.#$b#You should have seen how happy it made her! Always looking for a new thing to analyze that one. She'd make an excellent alchemist.$1",
"Alchemist_Dialogue.Sat4": "My alchemy master often spoke of a wise man from this area. I think his name was...Cannoli?#$b#He was the one who first told her about junimos, so I came here in search of them!#$b#And then I found Sprout here, so now this place is home for both of us!$1",
"Alchemist_Dialogue.Sun4": "Aha! I have finally perfected my chamomile tea recipe.#$b#I must remember to share it with Caroline the next time I see her.",

"Alchemist_Dialogue.Mon6": "Do you think someone gave Abigail rock candy as a child and she just assumed all rocks were candy?#$b#I'm not one to judge, but I find her appetite fascinating, nonetheless.$1",
"Alchemist_Dialogue.Tue6": "Oh, @! I wanted to mention the next time I saw you!#$b#Be careful of where you let your pets access on your farm. A lot of the flowers you grow can be toxic for an overly curious cat or dog.$3",
"Alchemist_Dialogue.Wed6": "Sprout says your farm is coming along well!#$b#He and his friends enjoy playing in the crop fields at night. He promises they only steal a few snacks.",
"Alchemist_Dialogue.Thu6": "A cave full of crystals certainly sounds intriguing, doesn't it, @?#$b#Oh, it's another reference I found in yet another old book of mine. It's so hard to tell what is purely fantasy and what is a clue meant to point the way to a new secret location!",
"Alchemist_Dialogue.Fri6": "Ah, hello, @! Another week done, another weekend to celebrate! Do you have anything exciting planned?#$b#Personally, I think I shall be testing out some new tea blends with the flowers I foraged yesterday.",
"Alchemist_Dialogue.Sat6": "I'll have to remember to stop by the saloon and give Emily those crystals I promised her.#$b#Imbuing spirit energy into them takes quite a bit of work, but I'm happy to help a fellow lover of the mystical and alchemical arts.",
"Alchemist_Dialogue.Sun6": "@! Just the person I wanted to see.$1#$b#I ended up synthesizing too much cake in my cauldron this morning, so I thought I'd share. [220 221] ",

"Alchemist_Dialogue.Mon8": "I wonder what kind of alchemical properties one could derive from a person's clothing.#$b#Like from a pair of purple shorts, perhaps?$6",
"Alchemist_Dialogue.Tue8": "Jas stopped me the other day to ask if she could be an alchemist, too. Isn't that sweet?#$b#She can see Sprout as well, so she might make a fine apprentice one day.$1",
"Alchemist_Dialogue.Wed8": "Sprout says that if you were to build a junimo hut on your farm, he could come over for a sleepover.#$b#He also promises NOT to throw a giant junimo party while he's there.$1",
"Alchemist_Dialogue.Thu8": "@! I found notes on another magical foraging location - this one seems to be a wildflower meadow on the peak of a mountain.#$b#The book doesn't give specifics, but apparently it was only discoverable by the most skilled foragers early in the spring season.",
"Alchemist_Dialogue.Fri8": "Oh, hello there, @! Quick, take a bite and let me know what you think. [608]#$b#I added in some foraged cinnamon. I think it really helps elevate the flavor!",
"Alchemist_Dialogue.Sat8": "You know, if you wanted to watch me perform some alchemy, you are more than welcome to.$1#$b#We could try synthesizing some new tea flavors, or maybe a magic potion?",
"Alchemist_Dialogue.Sun8": "Oh, @. I'm not feeling up to talking today.#$b#No, it's nothing serious... I just might have overdone it looming over my cauldron yesterday.",

"Alchemist_Dialogue.Mon10": "What if - now, hear me out on this - I used alchemy to make magical makeup?#$b#Think about it! Instead of vanishing cream for acne, it could be vanishing cream for total invisibility!",
"Alchemist_Dialogue.Tue10": "You are upset Sprout still isn't talking to you?#$b#I'm sorry to hear that, @. Sprout talks ABOUT you constantly, but he is a rather shy little guy in person.",
"Alchemist_Dialogue.Wed10": "How can I be out foraging and also mind the shop?#$b#Very simple - the person you see in the shop is actually three of Sprout's friends glamoured to look like me.#$b#Works like a charm.$6",
"Alchemist_Dialogue.Thu10": "A secret orchard...#$b#What? Oh, sorry, @. I must have been musing to myself.#$b#It seems the valley inspired many legends of secret foraging areas, and I'm determined to find them all!",
"Alchemist_Dialogue.Fri10": "There's my favorite guinea pig - I MEAN, taste tester!$1#$b#This time, I swapped in some wild berries and added a dash of vanilla bean essence. [610]",
"Alchemist_Dialogue.Sat10": "Leah actually came by the other day to ask me if I could use alchemy to craft her some unique dyes and paints.#$b#It's really quite heartwarming to have different folks from town coming by the atelier for help or to chat.",
"Alchemist_Dialogue.Sun10": "I think I'll take a visit to see my friend Rose soon. She lives over in Sunberry Forest.#$b#I'll have to introduce you to her one day, @!#$b#You two would get along well, I think.",

//Conversation Topics

"Alchemist_Dialogue.cc_Begin": "I thought I saw you poking around the old community center. It's nice to see someone aside from Sprout's friends taking an interest in it!",
"Alchemist_Dialogue.cc_Boulder": "The boulder being gone means more minerals will be accessible to the ground surrounding the mines!#$b#It should result in better soil, and hopefully, better forage as well.",
"Alchemist_Dialogue.cc_Greenhouse": "Sprout says he hopes you like your new greenhouse; he and his buds worked really hard on it.",
"Alchemist_Dialogue.cc_Minecart": "Oh, @! Was it you who managed to get the minecarts fixed? I must thank you. It really makes foraging around the valley MUCH more efficient!",
"Alchemist_Dialogue.cc_Complete": "Sprout told me the good news! You should be very proud of yourself, @.#$b#You've managed to give this town a bit of its community back, in more ways than one.",
"Alchemist_Dialogue.cc_Bridge": "Access to a quarry is quite the achievement, @. No doubt you'll need quite a bit of ore and gemstones if you ever want to start doing any alchemy of your own!",
"Alchemist_Dialogue.cc_Bus": "Oh, is the bus fixed? That's lovely news! I do not need it, as I have other ways of visiting the desert, but it will be nice for you to visit and for a few long distance friends to catch up with one another.",
"Alchemist_Dialogue.movieTheater": "A movie theater? Well, certainly that's an improvement on the old Joja wreck, but a community greenhouse would have been nice, too...",
"Alchemist_Dialogue.willyCrabs": "Really, @, I am surprised at your behavior. What Willy does in the privacy of his own home is none of my concern.",
"Alchemist_Dialogue.pamHouseUpgrade": "It really is something, @. You've singlehandedly done so much for Pam with this gift. Here's hoping others follow your example.",
"Alchemist_Dialogue.pamHouseUpgradeAnonymous": "I heard someone just went and commissioned Robin to build Pam a house. What a generous soul, and humble too! To remain anonymous like that...",
	
"Alchemist_Dialogue.LucikielArrives": "A demon in Pelican Town? Well, I don't think we should be quick to judge, @.#$b#You know, a lot of folks still think alchemists are heathens too.#$b#Let's just wait it out and see.",
"Alchemist_Dialogue.ReputationIncreased": "Now what did I tell you, @?#$b#We should always give folks a chance, and now Lucikiel is practically a Pelican Town regular!",
"Alchemist_Dialogue.MeetTheCats": "Talking cats?#$b#Really, @. Next you're going to tell me a little green guy is sitting on my shoulder.$u",
"Alchemist_Dialogue.ButteredJorts": "I will say, Pam's heart is in the right place.#$b#It's a shame that place involves so much butter.",
"Alchemist_Dialogue.keahi_prank": "Oh, dear. Um, @, how do I put this?#$b#Perhaps a dip in the lake might do you some good?",

"Alchemist_Dialogue.ReihanaIntro":"Let's not be quick to judge Reihana or Aicha. They didn't ask to be here and suddenly their lives are uprooted to our little town.#2#$b#I think we can at least try to be welcoming, don't you, @?$h",
"Alchemist_Dialogue.wedding":"Oh @, you must be over the moon! Congratulations and I wish you nothing but the best for this next step in your relationship.$h",
"Alchemist_Dialogue.luauBest":"Sometimes, @, throwing several disparate items into a cauldron - erm - I mean soup pot, really yields amazing results!$10",
"Alchemist_Dialogue.luauShorts":"To think I consumed soup with essence of...Lewis.$5#$b#Well, if you'll excuse me, I have to go home and eat several of Rose's scones to get the taste out of my mouth.$12",
"Alchemist_Dialogue.luauPoisoned":"WHAT was in that soup?$2#$b#I have to go and prepare a remedy of herbs immediately before the whole town turns ill.",
"Alchemist_Dialogue.AriGetsSlimed":"What happened to Ari was absolutely deplorable.$3#$b#Truly monstrous.$2#$b#Not at all funny.$10#$b#Nope, not one bit.$12",

"Alchemist_Dialogue.SterlingTrash":"Oh come now, @. Would you want me snickering about your unfortunate drinking escapades with our neighbors?$3#$b#I'm sure Sterling feels unpleasant enough as it is without us adding to it.$s",
"Alchemist_Dialogue.SterlingDrugs":"@, I must admit I'm a little concerned for our friend, Sterling. He seems to be acting strangely, but I don't want to be too forward and ask him.#2#$b#Perhaps I'll bring some scones over to Mia and see if she's noticed it as well.",
"Alchemist_Dialogue.SterlingRelapse":"It seems that altercation at Pierre's was even worse than I thought.$3#$b#I haven't seen Sterling in what feels like ages.#$b#Wherever he is, I hope knows he has people here in Sunberry who care very much for him.$s",
"Alchemist_Dialogue.SterlingApology":"I stopped by Pierre's and wouldn't you know it, Sterling was there!$9#$b#Back to work with that dashing smile. What a relief; I do hope this means he's feeling better.$1",

"SASS_MysteriousForage.04":"Maybe it's just a weed?",

"SASS_SproutMoonDrops.09":"Well, now that THAT's sorted...$13#$b#Like I was saying, Sprout says these are Moondrops, and being able to see and harvest them is a rare skill for humans! The fact that you can see them is fantastic news.#$b#I plan to try growing them, but perhaps you could as well?#$b#Whichever of us gets them to grow first has to share seeds with the other!",

"SASS_FaeFlowers.15":"We tried to tell Aunt Marnie, but they disappeared when we tried to show her, so she said we must have imagined it.$2#$b#But we play in the forest ALL the time, and I've never seen those flowers before, especially not a whole path made of them!$1",
"SASS_FaeFlowers.16":"Fascinating.$11#$b#Girls, I'm going to let you in on a little secret.$12#$b#I think... a wee fairy might have been playing a prank on you.$13",
"SASS_FaeFlowers.17":"And, when they saw you both get scared, they created this path to help you get home.$1#$b#Fae folk aren't inherently bad or evil, just mischievous.$0",
"SASS_FaeFlowers.18":"To be on the safe side, though, if you hear that giggling again, I wouldn't go near it.$2#$b#Promise you'll come find me instead, okay?#$b#Wouldn't want either of you walking into a fairy ring and being spirited away now, would we.$11",

"SASS_AlchemyTable.name":"More Uses for Alchemy Table",
"SASS_AlchemyTable.text":"@,^^I heard through the grapevine (or sunberry vine, I guess) that you now have the blueprints for an alchemy table! That's great news. Many of the magical forage items you've been gathering can be broken down at this alchemy table into useful components. You should get to crafting one quickly if you haven't yet. Get alchemizing! ^^Wildflour, The Alchemist",

"SASS_PropagatorRecipe.name":"Propagation Station",
"SASS_PropagatorRecipe.text":"@,^^I'm sharing the blueprints with you for a Propagation Station. Anyone interested in plants, be they alchemist, gardener, or farmer, should have one of these at their disposal. If you're looking for seeds and saplings you won't find at Pierre's (or, gods forbid, JojaMart), this Propagation Station is essential equipment. ^^Wildflour, The Alchemist",

"SASS_Mushroom_Recipes.name":"Mushroom Starters",
"SASS_Mushroom_Recipes.text":"@,^^You should now be able to develop various mushroom starters at your Propagation Station. Most mycelium thrive in a substrate such as wood or hay, so be sure to look at the recipes carefully to ensure you grow the best seeds and saplings. ^^Wildflour, The Alchemist",

"SASS_Magic_Tree_Recipes.name":"Tree Starters",
"SASS_Magic_Tree_Recipes.text":"@,^^You should now be able to develop magical tree saplings at your Propagation Station. These will not be easy saplings to develop. They will take all your skills as a farmer, forager, and, dare I say, budding alchemist? Best of luck, my friend. ^^Wildflour, The Alchemist",

"SASS_MoonDrop_Recipes.name":"Moondrop Starters",
"SASS_MoonDrop_Recipes.text":"@,^^You should now be able to develop various Moondrop Starters at your Propagation Station. Fingers crossed that one of us is able to grow them! ^^Wildflour, The Alchemist",

"SASS_Bee_Familiars.name":"Bumbling Bees",
"SASS_Bee_Familiars.text":"Hello, @!^^As a final thanks for being such a lovely friend and help during my experiments: I've recently learned about rare bee familiars who will provide honey and even flower seeds to those they deem worthy. Sounds fascinating, right?^^As always, check the ledger if you're interested!^^Best, Wildflour ",

"SASS_Cat_Familiars.name":"Curious Cats",
"SASS_Cat_Familiars.text":"Hello, @!^^Thanks again for acquiring all of the ingredients I needed! As a thank you, I'd be willing to introduce you to a few cat familiars. They are quite curious and will bring you things like monster loot and other items they find while roaming about. Check the ledger by the cauldron for more info.^^Talk to you soon! ^Wildflour, The Alchemist",

"SASS_Crow_Familiars.name":"Cunning Crows",
"SASS_Crow_Familiars.text":"Hello, @!^^Thank you so much for the forage specimens. I think they should work perfectly for my next alchemical project. In the meantime, have you ever thought about adding some familiars to your farm? They come in various shapes and sizes and can help you procure all manner of items. If you're interested, I have a few crows that would be willing to be your familiars if treated properly. Stop by the atelier and check out the ledger book by my cauldron. ^^Bye for now! ^Wildflour, The Alchemist",

"SASS_Fox_Familiars.name":"Feisty Foxes",
"SASS_Fox_Familiars.text":"@, ^^Seriously, has anyone ever told you that you are quite the gopher? Well, rest assured, it's very much appreciated. Perhaps you'd fancy a fox or two as a new familiar? They love sharing fruits and berries they forage with those they trust. SO YOU BETTER BE NICE TO THEM! Else Sprout will throw void eggs at your house. He told me so himself! ^^Your Friend, Wildflour",

"SASS_Toad_Familiars.name":"Terrific Toads",
"SASS_Toad_Familiars.text":"How do you feel about toads?^^I think they are vastly underrated when it comes to familiars. Everyone's always talking about cats and crows, but toads know where the best mushrooms are, and that makes them a top-tier familiar in my book. Speaking of my book, feel free to pop by the atelier and check out the ledger to add a few toad familiars to your farm! Consider it a thank you for bringing me all those magical mushrooms. ^^Until next time! ^Wildflour",

"SASS_Totem_Recipes.title":"Secret Warp Totems",
"SASS_Totem_Recipes.text":"@, ^^ I think I can trust you enough to share some of my most advanced alchemical recipes with you. Be warned: these are one way only so don't come haunt me if you transport yourself somewhere you can't get back from. ^^Just kidding! These pixie dust totems can warp you to all manner of fantastical forage locations, so use them wisely! ^^Your friend, Wildflour",

"SASS_Rose_Party_Prep.text":"@, ^^ You are being entrusted with the most important of quests: deliver these invitations DISCREETLY. Once you have completed your mission, I will take care of the rest for Operation Garden Fete. ^^The Alchemist",
