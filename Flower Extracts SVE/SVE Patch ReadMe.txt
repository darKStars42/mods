STARDEW VALLEY EXPANDED INSTRUCTIONS

In order to enable extracts for the Diamond Flower, Ferngill Primrose, Goldenrod, Swamp Flower, Thistle, and Winter Star Rose, follow these steps:

1. Open the Stardew Valley Expanded mod folder
2. Open the [CP] Stardew Valley Expanded folder
3. Open the code folder
4. Open the Item folder
5. Delete the Objects.json currently in the Item folder
