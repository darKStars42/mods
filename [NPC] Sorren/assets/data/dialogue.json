	// GENERIC DIALOGUE
    "Mon": "Uh, hi, I guess.", 
    "Tue": "%Sorren nods at you amiably, but he doesn't seem to be in a talking mood.",
    "Wed": "I wasn't always a miner, but it's in my blood, so I guess it was inevitable.",
    "Thu": "Sorry, I'm not very good at small talk.$3",
    "Fri": "Almost time for the weekend. Doesn't much matter for you or me, though, does it?",
    "Sat": "When I was a kid in school, I always looked forward to the weekend.#$b#When you grow up, you realize weekends are just like any other day.",
    "Sun": "No such thing as a day of rest for me. I prefer to keep busy.",

    "Mon2": "Stardew Valley is a nice place. The people here all know each other.", 
    "Tue2": "I don't like Tuesdays. You know how some people call Wednesday Hump Day? I think my Hump Day is Tuesday.$2",
    "Wed2": "Back in Grampleton, there was a lot of wood to work with. I still whittle sometimes.",
    "Thu2": "Hi, @. Can I ask you a question? #$q 247106/247107 qwork_1#How does it feel to work so closely with the earth?

	        "qwork_earthy": "Well, that makes sense. I don't know what I expected.",
	        "qwork_hands": "I feel the same way. Working up a sweat and getting dirty is so worth it in the end. #$b#Not to mention, you work up such an appetite that whatever you eat afterwards tastes even more delicious!$1",
	        "qwork_grow": "Wow, that does sound pretty great. I don't know if I'd have the patience, though.$1",
	        "qwork_1": "$p 247107#Farming sounds like rewarding work. Just make sure you take a break once in a while. There is such a thing as working too hard.",

    "Fri4": "Do you fish, @? Nothing like a good fish dinner.$1#$e#Mmm, fish... Oops, I'm making myself hungry.",
    "Sat4": "I've been thinking about putting down roots here in Stardew Valley. Just don't know how I'd go about it...",
    "Sun4": "I don't know if I believe in Yoba, but I do believe that every living thing has a spirit.",

    "Tue6": "A lot of the single people around here are at least ten years younger than me.#$b#Makes me feel kinda old.$2",
    "Thu6": "Hey, @, good to see you! Hope you're taking care of yourself.$1",
    "Fri6": "Willy convinced me to go fishing with him the other day. I brought my catch back to Gus and we both had a good meal.$1",
    "Sat6": "Do you think Robin would build me a house? Guess I'd have to scrape together a good bit of money first.#$e#Haha, maybe I'll get a tent and live in the mountains like Linus.$1",
    "Sun6": "Gus lets me cook in the kitchen on occasion. We don't have the ingredients for it here, but I can make a mean raspberry crepe!$1",

	"summer_Sun6": "I never went to the beach in the summer when I was a kid. We were too far away from the ocean. I'd go now, but...

	"fall_Tue": "Doesn't matter if I get sweaty working in this season. I just come outside and the wind dries me right up.",
	"fall_Tue4": "You can catch salmon this time of year. Pan sear 'em in butter, spritz with a little lemon - mmm, delicious.$1",

	"fall_Sat4": "Should I carve a pumpkin? Seems a bit silly for someone my age.$3",
	"fall_Sun": "It's grape season, and that means wine.#$b#It sounds a bit snobby, but I do enjoy a nice glass of wine now and then.$1",

	// WINTER DIALOGUE
	"winter_Tue": "My job is technically indoors, so winter doesn't slow me down.",

	"winter_Thu": "No crops to grow in winter. You should go mining!$1",
	"winter_Thu4": "Make sure to bundle up, @. You don't want to catch a cold.",
	"winter_Fri": "You're always running around no matter the weather, huh?",
	"winter_Fri4": "This time of year makes people want to spend time with family, but my folks died years ago.$2",

    "BlackSmith2": "Working hard on those upgrades? I'll keep Clint supplied with plenty of ore in case you want to buy some.",
    "Blacksmith4": "Clint is a cool guy. Neither of us are very talkative. Maybe that's why we get along.#$e#Well, that and the fact that we both like working with metal.$1",
    "Blacksmith6": "Clint let me use the forge once. It's harder to shape things out of metal than I thought it would be.$1",

	"Mountain_Thu": "Just taking a breather, don't mind me.",
    "Mountain_Thu2": "Cracking open a rock with your pickaxe can be kinda fun, you know.",

	        "qwhittle_what": "Little things like animal figurines, mostly. I took it up when I lived in Grampleton. It's really relaxing once you get the hang of it.$1",
	        "qwhittle_cool": "You think so? People usually think of it as an old man's hobby. It's just little stuff, but I love it.$4",
	        "qwhittle_no": "Well, you're not the one doing it. You're more likely to cut yourself with the knife than get a splinter, anyway.$5",
	        "qwhittle_1": "$p 247104#Maybe I'll make you something some time. You've got animals on the farm to model it after, right?#$b#Uh, if that's okay with you.$3",

    "Mountain_Fri8": "Hey there, @! Good to see you here.$1#$b#This might sound funny, but I get a little extra energy whenever I see you. You inspire me to work a little bit harder.$4",
    "Mountain_Sat": "Someone was throwing rocks at that poor homeless guy's tent. If I find out who did it, I'll give 'em a piece of my mind, that's for sure.$5",
    "Mountain_Sat2": "Linus is a good guy. I respect him trying to live life on his own terms.",
    "winterMountain": "When the mountain is covered in snow, it reminds me of home...",
    "winterMountain4": "Isn't it beautiful here? I grew up in the mountains, up north where it's cold more often.$1",

	"summer_17": "%Sorren looks so sad that you decide not to bother him right now.",
