"Ashida.Sun6": "Why don’t you ever visit your family, @?$2#$b#I can’t hardly see mine because of the war; Maybe it’s because I’m a mother, but I hope you don’t take seeing them for granted.$2 ",
"Ashida.Mon8": "You know, one day little Isaac’s gonna grow big, and I’ll have to change out his bedroom.$0#$b#But the issue arises in finding furniture; there’s not many options in town except for Robin, but she has a very... limited... stock.$2",
"Ashida.Tue8": "Maybe the ladies could workout on the farm instead of going to Pierre’s.$6#$b#They’d do real work, help out a local business *and* feel even better about themselves afterward.$0",

"Ashida.Sun8": "I love my sister, but I never understood why she named her daughter Mora.$0#$b#It means ‘blackberry’ in another language that we don’t even speak, that seems insensitive to me.$2#$e#She’s still my sister though, and Mora’s still my niece, so I can’t be too upset.$1",
"Ashida.Mon10": "We need a horse for our farm too.$0#$b#The walk into town takes hours, it’s terrible being able to take little Isaac out for only two hours before bringing him back.$2#$e#It’s not that safe for him on a horse, though, isn’t it?$3",
"Ashida.Tue10": "Maybe Haley would let us borrow her camera for family photos?$0#$b#That’d be cute, don’t you think?$1",
"Ashida.Wed10": "Sometimes I’ll send home some bird feathers, or dried flowers back home to tell everyone how I’m doing.$0#$b#You should do the same, @. It always makes my family ask me questions about how I’ve been, it feels great.$1",
"Ashida.Thu10": "I like to wear a beautiful floral dress in the Summer, but it gets in the way of farming.$0#$b#The price of fashion is killer.$1",
"Ashida.Fri10": "I saw how large your house has gotten, @; I have some advice.$0#$e#If there’s any rooms that people don’t visit often, just shut and lock the door, and now you don’t need to clean.$1#$b#I’ve locked off half the house for this, but that’s a half less to clean.$1",
"Ashida.Sat10": "Would you like some sweet tea sometime, @?$1#$b#I don’t let *anyone* drink with me either, so take this invitation *very* seriously.$0#$e#Oh, who am I kidding, it’s just tea!$7",
