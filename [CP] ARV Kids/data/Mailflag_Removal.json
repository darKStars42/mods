		//"RemoveMail Current GrowingValley_Firstborn_Female",

		//"RemoveMail Current GrowingValley_Secondborn_Male",

		//"RemoveMail Current GrowingValley_Secondborn_Other",
		
		//"RemoveMail Current GrowingValley_Custom_Firstborn",
		//"RemoveMail Current GrowingValley_Custom_Secondborn",
		
		//"RemoveMail Current GrowingValley_ForceLoad_Default_Firstborn",
		//"RemoveMail Current GrowingValley_ForceLoad_Clara_Firstborn",

	//The custom mailflag naming format below is the same suggested naming format as the one in the child implementation template.
	//By default in this template, this trigger action is commented out, meaning it won't do anything. You can remove the "/*" and "*/" after making your custom mailflag to uncomment it so it will function. 
	
	//It isn't necessary to make custom mailflags, but it can give handy information about which kid is loaded to other mods.
