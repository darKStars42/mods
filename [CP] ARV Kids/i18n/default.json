		//Instead of using @ for the player's name, kids can call their player parents "Mama" or "Papa" (or their name if the player enables a setting). This is done by inserting {{ParentFarmer}} into the text.
	
		//Something similar is done for the player's spouse/roommate: insert {{CompanionRef}} into the text for kids to call the other adult in their life Mommy, Daddy, Auntie, Uncle, or their name, depending on if the player's companion is a spouse or roommate.
	
		//We can get pronouns for the spouse by reading their gender data, or you can hardcode them in your writing if you don't expect this child to be anyone else's kid. Read the extended token notes for more information.
	
		//If the child's own name comes up in dialogue, insert {{DisplayName}} into the text. If they talk about their sibling, use {{SiblingDisplayName}}. Be careful with this, as the first child might not have a younger sibling yet! Read the extended token notes for more information.
