## FAQ
- **Jade is stuck in bed/standing in the same spot as another NPC/walking through walls -** Try sleeping for one day. If that doesn't fix it, then it may be a scheduling error. Please make a bug report on the NexusMods page, including a link to your SMAPI log (look at smapi.io for info). Please note the day, season, and year the bug appeared as well. Please include a screenshot or description of where the bug takes place.
- **Jade is standing at the same spot as another NPC at a festival -** This is a festival placement error, and usually is from other modded content. Please make a bug report on the NexusMods page, including a link to your SMAPI log (look at smapi.io for info) and I will attempt to add compatibility. Please include a screenshot.
- **I selected the romantic option in the 8th heart event. What happens now? -** The romantic option is treated as the default path. You'll need to give her a bouquet and get her to 10 hearts to see the 10th heart event. The "8.2" heart event is just the platonic version of the 10th heart event. You cannot move from this path to the platonic path.
- **I selected the platonic option in the 8th heart event. What happens now? -** The platonic option allows access to the "8.2" heart event, which is the platonic version of the 10th heart event. You will get mail for it after seeing the 8th heart event. You can move to the romantic path by giving Jade a bouquet before you see the 8.2 heart event.

## To-do
- LittleNPCs characters
- lots of redone dialogue
- make 8 heart map seasonal?
- optimize 2 heart and 10 heart SVE patches
