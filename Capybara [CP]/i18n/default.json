On sunny days, they'll go out and roam and pick up some useful foraging.  But what makes them REALLY special is how well they get along with other animals. Pick up one (or a couple) and you'll see what I mean.^^Thanks again,^Marnie",

I've been taking care of them and I think I may be able to carry them in the shop from now on.^^On sunny days, they'll go out and roam and pick up some useful foraging.  But what makes them REALLY special is how well they get along with other animals. If you wanted to pick up one (or a couple), you'll see what I mean.^^Stop by any time,^Marnie",
