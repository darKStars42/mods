It was small, modest, but full of life. People didn’t just come to buy things—they came to talk, to share their day, to ask for advice. My father loved that place… until he lost everything.#Morris, the Joja manager, claimed to be his friend. He promised to help him grow, said it would be a good deal. My father believed him. But the debts came before the profits, and by the time we realized it, there was no way out. He was forced to sell. The day they took down our sign and replaced it with JojaMart’s cold blue glow, my father stopped smiling. He never recovered. A year later, he was gone. Not from illness, but because the weight of his loss was too much to bear.#For a long time, I avoided looking at that place. The pain was suffocating. But at some point, the sorrow turned into strength. I didn’t want my father’s story to end like that. So I saved. I worked wherever I could, learned everything about running a business, and when I finally had enough, I opened my own little shop. It wasn’t big or fancy, but it had something Joja never would: soul.#When the first customer walked in and smiled at me, I felt it. My father was there, in every detail, in every laugh that filled the space. I didn’t just start over. I carried on his story. And this time, no one could take it away from me.",
