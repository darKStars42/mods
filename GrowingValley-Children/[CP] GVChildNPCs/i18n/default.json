	//Notes for translators:
	//Anything after two slashes ("//") is a comment for translators that doesn't need to be translated. I will also leave comments if a line or section has been added or changed in an update to the mod.
	
	//Added in 1.2.1: There's a new folder named "dialogue_files" in the i18n folder. Inside are .json files which include almost all the dialogue coding in this mod. If you need to make a change for your translation (to add a token to a line that needs one, or even add completely new lines if, for example, the dialogue needs variants for gendered language that doesn't exist in English), these files will give you the power to do so. i18n translations will still load by default; this is just if you need power beyond i18n's limits :)
	
	//If I change any files in the "dialogue_files" folder, I will note the changes made in the "changelog.txt" file.
	
	//Notes for 1.4.0: 
		//Config options and most of the "Default" strings have been moved to the GVChildrenSMAPI component. The translation keys used in the new file are identical to the old ones, but a few new options have been added.
		//The folder names and locations have changed. 
			//Growth Spurt is now a standalone mod in a folder called "[CP] GVGrowthSpurt".
			//The main "GrowingValley" folder is now "GrowingValley-Children".
			//Child NPCs' folder is now named "[CP] GVChildNPCs" (not "[NPC] GVChildNPCs". I don't know why I named it that and it was bothering me).
	
	//Changed in 1.4.0: Tokens can now be used in any line! Some tokens have been renamed, but the previous names should still work for now. Do try to update any existing tokens to the new names, though (Ctrl+F to find and replace would be best).
		//	Old -> New 
		//{{ParentSpouse}} -> {{CompanionRef}}
		//{{FirstbornDisplayName}} -> {{SiblingDisplayName}}
		//{{SecondbornDisplayName}} -> {{SiblingDisplayName}}
		//{{SpSub}} -> {{CoSub}}
		//{{SpObj}} -> {{CoObj}}
		//{{SpPD}} -> {{CoPD}}
		//{{SpPos}} -> {{CoPos}}
		//{{SpRef}} -> {{CoRef}}
	
	//////////////////////////////////////
	
	//Notes for translators:
		//If a line uses a token (like {{ParentFarmer}}, {{CompanionRef}}, {{CoSub}}, etc., which gets replaced when the line appears in the game), it can be used in the translated line anywhere you want and as many times as you want (or removed if you don't need it!). 
		//If it doesn't already have a token you want to use, it would have to be added to the code. If you keep having this issue, you might want to reach out to me (I'm somesillypenguin on Discord, and you can DM me or find me in the Stardew Valley Official Discord); I can help change the code to allow your translation to use the token you need.
		//If you know about modding Stardew Valley, you can try changing the files in dialogue_files instead of using i18n, giving you maximum control.
		//Alternatively, you can try to write in a way that means you don't have to use any tokens. (I might test adding token definitions to all of the lines so they can be added freely, but I'm not sure if that will work well.)
