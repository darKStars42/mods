----------------------
Any correctly named images in this folder will override the images in-game with the ones you have supplied.

If you want to use your own images for your generic children, move the needed files into this folder. Make sure to name your files correctly to override the child appearance you want to override (the correct names are used in the template files if you want to reference those).

If you're not sure how to start, try copy/pasting each of the templates for the files you want to use into the main folder (the folder that this text file is in), which will allow you to see them loaded in-game in the relevant locations.
